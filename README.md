# Front-end-Projects
The online book shopping named "Book Safari" project aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly
website that allows users to explore a wide range of books and read customer reviews. Throughout the project, 
we have designed and structured the website using HTML, styled it with CSS, and added interactive elements using
JavaScript and the Swiper library.
The website's main features include a responsive navigation bar, a hero section showcasing featured books, a 
carousel displaying customer reviews, and a section highlighting popular blogs related to books. The layout is designed 
to be attractive and intuitive, encouraging users to browse through the books and blogs seamlessly.
